# Claude Development Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for AI-assisted development using Claude and the PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) system. These guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality code generation and maintainable development practices.

## Claude Slash Commands and Task Management

### Using Slash Commands

Claude has access to powerful slash commands that should be used whenever possible to complete tasks efficiently. Always prioritize using these commands over manual instructions:

#### File Operations

- **`/read`** - Read file contents to understand current state
- **`/edit`** - Make precise edits to files with clear instructions
- **`/search`** - Search for specific code patterns or text
- **`/grep`** - Find exact text matches across files
- **`/list`** - Explore directory structure

#### Development Tools

- **`/run`** - Execute terminal commands for setup, testing, and deployment
- **`/mcp_supabase_*`** - Database operations, project management, and migrations
- **`/mcp_github_*`** - Repository management, issue tracking, and code review
- **`/mcp_context7_*`** - Access to up-to-date library documentation

#### AI-Assisted Development

- **`/codebase_search`** - Semantic search for relevant code patterns
- **`/file_search`** - Fuzzy file search for quick navigation

### Task Management Guidelines

#### For Long-Running Tasks

When working on complex, multi-step tasks:

1. **Break Down the Task**: Divide large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
2. **Use Slash Commands**: Leverage available tools to automate repetitive tasks
3. **Provide Progress Updates**: Give clear status updates at each step
4. **Suggest Next Steps**: Always provide actionable next steps when completing a phase

#### Progress Reporting Format

When completing a task phase, use this format:

```markdown
## âœ… Task Phase Complete: [Phase Name]

### What was accomplished:

- [ ] Specific achievement 1
- [ ] Specific achievement 2
- [ ] Specific achievement 3

### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Next Action**: [Specific action with slash command if applicable]
2. **Follow-up Tasks**: [List of related tasks]
3. **Potential Issues**: [Any concerns or blockers to address]

### Commands Used:

- `/command1` - [purpose]
- `/command2` - [purpose]
```

#### Example Task Flow

```markdown
## ðŸ”„ Working on: User Authentication System

### Current Phase: Database Schema Setup

- [x] Created users table with proper constraints
- [x] Added authentication-related columns
- [ ] Setting up Row Level Security policies

### Next Steps:

1. **Run RLS migration**: `/mcp_supabase_apply_migration`
2. **Test authentication flow**: `/run npm test auth`
3. **Update API documentation**: `/edit docs/api.md`

### Commands Used:

- `/mcp_supabase_apply_migration` - Created users table
- `/mcp_supabase_list_tables` - Verified table creation
```

### Best Practices for Slash Commands

#### 1. Always Use Available Tools

- Check available commands before manual work
- Use `/read` to understand current file state
- Use `/search` to find relevant patterns
- Use `/run` for terminal operations

#### 2. Be Specific with Commands

- Provide clear parameters for each command
- Explain the purpose of each command used
- Use appropriate flags and options

#### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully

- When commands fail, provide clear error analysis
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Document any workarounds needed

#### 4. Maintain Context

- Keep track of which files have been modified
- Note any configuration changes made
- Document any new dependencies added

### Integration with PRP System

When using slash commands with PRPs:

1. **Reference PRP Requirements**: Use `/read` to load PRP files
2. **Follow ai_docs Patterns**: Use `/search` to find relevant patterns
3. **Implement Step by Step**: Use `/edit` for each implementation step
4. **Test Continuously**: Use `/run` for testing and validation
5. **Document Progress**: Update PRP with completion status

## PRP System Integration

### What is a PRP?

A PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) is a structured document that provides comprehensive context to AI for generating production-ready code. It includes:

- Clear requirements and specifications
- Technical context and architecture patterns
- AI documentation references (ai_docs)
- Implementation guidelines and success criteria

### PRP Structure

2. **Task Breakdown**: Divide into phases with clear deliverables
3. **Progress Tracking**: Use the progress reporting format for each phase
4. **Next Steps**: Always provide actionable next steps when completing a phase

#### Task Completion Template

```markdown
## ðŸŽ¯ Task Complete: [Task Name]

### Summary of Accomplishments:

- [ ] [Specific achievement with impact]
- [ ] [Specific achievement with impact]

### Claude API Integration

```python
# Example integration with Claude API
import anthropic
import os

def run_with_claude(prp_content):
    # Set up Claude API client
    client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("CLAUDE_API_KEY"))

    # Prepare prompt with PRP content and task management instructions
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert software developer. Please implement the following feature:

    {prp_content}

    IMPORTANT: Use available slash commands whenever possible and provide clear next steps.

    Please provide:
    1. Complete implementation code using appropriate tools
    2. Unit tests
    3. Brief explanation of the implementation
    4. Clear next steps for testing and deployment
    5. Any potential issues to monitor
    """

    # Send to Claude
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=4000,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    return response.content[0].text
```

### Custom AI Integration

```python
# Modify PRPs/run_prp.py for custom AI integration
def run_with_ai(prp_content, ai_tool="claude"):
    if ai_tool == "claude":
        return run_with_claude(prp_content)
    elif ai_tool == "openai":
        return run_with_openai(prp_content)
    elif ai_tool == "custom":
        return run_with_custom_ai(prp_content)
    else:
        print(f"Unsupported AI tool: {ai_tool}")
        return None
```

## Code Quality Standards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI generates inconsistent code**

   - Review ai_docs for completeness
   - Update patterns to match actual codebase
   - Be more specific in PRP requirements
   - Check for conflicting patterns

2. **PRPs take too long to create**

   - Use templates and examples
   - Reuse patterns from existing ai_docs
   - Start with simple PRPs and iterate
   - Focus on essential requirements first

3. **Generated code doesn't work**

   - Verify ai_docs are up to date
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Review error handling
   - Test generated code thoroughly

4. **Team adoption is slow**

   - Provide training and examples
   - Start with simple features
   - Show successful implementations
   - Create team-specific ai_docs

5. **Slash commands not working as expected**

   - Verify command syntax and parameters
   - Check for required dependencies or setup
   - Use `/read` to understand current file state
   - Provide clear error messages and context
   - Suggest alternative approaches when commands fail

6. **Long-running tasks lack clear progress**
   - Break down tasks into smaller phases
   - Use progress reporting format consistently
   - Provide regular status updates
   - Always include next steps when completing phases
   - Document any blockers or dependencies
