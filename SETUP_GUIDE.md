# PRP System Setup Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) system has been successfully set up! Here's what was created:

### 📁 Directory Structure

```
PRPs/
├── templates/
│   └── prp_base.md          # Base template for all PRPs
├── ai_docs/                 # AI documentation framework
│   ├── README.md            # AI docs guide
│   ├── react-typescript-conventions.md
│   └── supabase-patterns.md
├── examples/                # Example PRPs
├── run_prp.py              # Python runner script
└── README.md               # PRP system guide
```

### 🚀 How to Use the PRP System

#### 1. Create a New PRP

```bash
# Copy the base template
cp PRPs/templates/prp_base.md PRPs/my-feature.md

# Edit the PRP with your requirements
nano PRPs/my-feature.md
```

#### 2. Run Your PRP with AI

```bash
# Execute the PRP
python PRPs/run_prp.py PRPs/my-feature.md

# Or validate the structure only
python PRPs/run_prp.py PRPs/my-feature.md --validate-only
```

#### 3. Example PRP Created

I've created an example PRP for you: `PRPs/example-user-auth.md`

- Shows how to structure a complete feature requirement
- Demonstrates proper use of ai_docs references
- Includes comprehensive requirements and implementation steps

### 📚 Key Components

#### PRP Templates (`PRPs/templates/`)

- **prp_base.md**: Base template with all required sections
- Copy this for each new feature you want to develop

#### AI Documentation (`PRPs/ai_docs/`)

- Contains patterns and conventions for your tech stack
- Referenced in PRPs to provide AI with project context
- Automatically detected and suggested by the tech stack script

#### Python Runner (`PRPs/run_prp.py`)

- Validates PRP structure
- Executes PRPs with AI assistance
- Provides helpful feedback and guidance

### 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact patterns and function names
2. **Reference ai_docs**: Always include relevant documentation
3. **Iterate**: Refine PRPs based on AI output quality
4. **Document**: Keep PRPs updated as requirements change

### 🔧 Customization

#### Adding New Technologies

1. Run: `python scripts/detect-tech-stack.py`
2. Create corresponding ai_docs files
3. Update documentation with new patterns

#### Modifying Patterns

1. Edit ai_docs files with your project's specific patterns
2. Update PRP templates if needed
3. Test with sample PRPs

### 📖 Next Steps

1. **Review the example PRP**: `PRPs/example-user-auth.md`
2. **Create your first PRP**: Copy the template and start developing
3. **Customize ai_docs**: Add your project's specific patterns
4. **Integrate with your workflow**: Use PRPs for all new features
