# Example PRP: Slash Commands and Task Management Test

## Overview

This PRP demonstrates the proper use of slash commands and task management guidelines as outlined in the updated Claude Development Guidelines. It serves as a practical example of how to structure PRPs with clear progress tracking and next steps.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Create a simple React component using slash commands
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Include unit tests
- [ ] Demonstrate progress reporting format

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Component should render in under 100ms
- Security: Follow React security best practices
- Accessibility: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Build Tool: Vite

### Architecture Patterns

- State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Component Pattern: Functional components with proper prop types
- Error Handling: Error boundaries and try-catch patterns
- Testing Pattern: Component testing with user interactions

## All Needed Context

### AI Documentation (Recommended)

- **file**: PRPs/ai_docs/react-typescript-conventions.md
  **why**: Component structure and TypeScript patterns for React development
- **file**: PRPs/ai_docs/cc_common_workflows.md
  **why**: Common development workflows and best practices

### Project Files

- **file**: package.json
  **why**: To understand current dependencies and project setup
- **file**: tsconfig.json
  **why**: To verify TypeScript configuration
- **file**: src/components/
  **why**: To see existing component patterns and structure

### External Documentation

- **url**: https://react.dev/reference/react
  **why**: Latest React documentation for component patterns
- **url**: https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
  **why**: Testing library documentation for component testing

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Requirements

- [ ] CRITICAL: Use slash commands for all file operations and development tasks
- [ ] CRITICAL: Follow the progress reporting format for each phase
- [ ] IMPORTANT: Implement proper TypeScript types and error handling
- [ ] NOTE: This is a demonstration PRP to validate the new guidelines

### Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1: Project Assessment**

   - Use `/read` to examine project structure
   - Use `/list` to explore component directory
   - Use `/search` to find existing patterns

2. **Phase 2: Component Creation**

   - Use `/edit` to create the new component
   - Use `/edit` to add TypeScript types
   - Use `/edit` to implement error handling

3. **Phase 3: Testing Implementation**

   - Use `/edit` to create unit tests
   - Use `/run` to execute tests
   - Use `/read` to verify test results

4. **Phase 4: Documentation and Validation**
   - Use `/edit` to update documentation
   - Use `/run` to validate build process
   - Use `/read` to verify final implementation

## Expected Output

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] Follows project TypeScript conventions
- [ ] Implements proper error handling with try-catch
- [ ] Includes comprehensive testing with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Follows accessibility guidelines (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- [ ] Uses slash commands for all operations

### Deliverables

- [ ] React component with TypeScript types
- [ ] Unit tests with React Testing Library
- [ ] Error boundary implementation
- [ ] Progress reports for each phase
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Component renders correctly without errors
- [ ] All tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] Progress reporting format is followed correctly
- [ ] Slash commands are used effectively throughout
- [ ] Next steps are clearly defined at each phase

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Project Assessment

- [ ] Examine project structure with `/read` and `/list`
- [ ] Identify existing component patterns
- [ ] Verify TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Document findings and next steps

### Phase 2: Component Creation

- [ ] Create component file using `/edit`
- [ ] Implement TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Test component rendering

### Phase 3: Testing Implementation

- [ ] Create test file using `/edit`
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Execute tests using `/run`
- [ ] Verify test coverage

### Phase 4: Documentation and Validation

- [ ] Update README with component documentation
- [ ] Validate build process using `/run`
- [ ] Final review and cleanup
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Expected Commands to Use

- `/read` - Read project files and configuration
- `/list` - Explore directory structure
- `/search` - Find existing patterns and components
- `/edit` - Create and modify component files
- `/run` - Execute tests and build commands
- `/codebase_search` - Search for relevant code patterns
