### 2. Project Management
- Create, update, and delete projects
- Assign team members to projects
- Set project deadlines and milestones
- Project dashboard with progress visualization

### 3. Task Management
- Create tasks within projects
- Assign tasks to team members
- Set task priorities (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Task statuses (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
- Due dates and time estimates
- Task dependencies
- Subtasks support
- File attachments for tasks

### 4. Team Collaboration
- Comments on tasks
- @mentions to notify team members
- Activity feed showing recent updates
- Real-time notifications
- Team chat per project

### 5. Dashboard & Analytics
- Personal dashboard showing assigned tasks
- Project overview with task distribution
- Burndown charts
- Time tracking and reporting
- Productivity metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- State management (Redux or Context API)
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Modern UI with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
- Real-time updates using WebSockets

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- RESTful API design
- JWT authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling middleware

### Database
- PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- Database migrations support

### Infrastructure
- Docker containerization
- Environment-based configuration
- Logging system
- Basic CI/CD pipeline setup

## Data Models

### User
```
- id (UUID)
- email (unique)
- username (unique)
- password (hashed)
- firstName
- lastName
- avatar
- role
- isActive
- createdAt
- updatedAt
```

### Project
```
- id (UUID)
- name
- description
- ownerId (User)
- startDate
- endDate
- status (Active, On Hold, Completed)
- createdAt
- updatedAt
```

### Task
```
- id (UUID)
- projectId (Project)
- title
- description
- assigneeId (User)
- creatorId (User)
- priority
- status
- dueDate
- estimatedHours
- actualHours
- parentTaskId (Task, nullable)
- createdAt
- updatedAt
```

### Comment
```
- id (UUID)
- taskId (Task)
- userId (User)
- content
- mentions (User[])
- createdAt
- updatedAt
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- POST /api/auth/refresh
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password
- POST /api/auth/reset-password

### Users
- GET /api/users (admin only)
- GET /api/users/:id
- PUT /api/users/:id
- DELETE /api/users/:id (admin only)

### Projects
- GET /api/projects
- GET /api/projects/:id
- POST /api/projects
- PUT /api/projects/:id
- DELETE /api/projects/:id
- GET /api/projects/:id/members
- POST /api/projects/:id/members
- DELETE /api/projects/:id/members/:userId

### Tasks
- GET /api/tasks
- GET /api/tasks/:id
- POST /api/tasks
- PUT /api/tasks/:id
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id
- GET /api/tasks/:id/subtasks
- POST /api/tasks/:id/attachments
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id/attachments/:attachmentId

### Comments
- GET /api/tasks/:taskId/comments
- POST /api/tasks/:taskId/comments
- PUT /api/comments/:id
- DELETE /api/comments/:id

## UI/UX Considerations

### Key Pages
1. Login/Register page
2. Dashboard (personal overview)
3. Projects list page
4. Project detail page with task board
5. Task detail modal/page
6. User profile page
7. Team members page
8. Reports/Analytics page

### Design Requirements
- Clean, modern interface
- Drag-and-drop for task reordering
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Dark mode support
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty states with helpful prompts
- Search functionality across projects and tasks

## Security Considerations
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF tokens
- Rate limiting
- Secure password requirements
- Session timeout
- Audit logging for sensitive actions

## Performance Requirements
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms for most endpoints
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Pagination for large data sets
- Image optimization for avatars and attachments

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for critical business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for key user flows
- Minimum 70% code coverage
- Performance testing for load scenarios

## Deployment & DevOps
- Dockerized application
- Environment variables for configuration
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Database backup strategy
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Future Enhancements (Stretch Goals)
1. Mobile application (React Native)
2. Calendar integration
3. Email notifications
4. Third-party integrations (Slack, GitHub)
5. Advanced reporting with custom dashboards
6. Time tracking with timesheets
7. Kanban and Gantt chart views
8. Resource management features
9. Budget tracking per project
10. AI-powered task suggestions

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully create accounts and manage profiles
- Teams can collaborate on projects in real-time
- Tasks can be created, assigned, and tracked through completion
- The system handles concurrent users without performance degradation
- The UI is intuitive and requires minimal training
- Data integrity is maintained across all operations

## Timeline Estimate
